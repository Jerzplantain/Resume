                    I've been in search of the Lord Jesus from a very young age. Ever since i met my 
                    wife in 2018, i've taken this <br> more seriously. I've been working everyday
                    to get closer and closer to Jesus, and leave behind wordly things. <br>
                    <br>
                    Job 1:21
                            21 and said: “Naked I came from my mother's womb, 
                            and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.”
